Retail Sales Dashboard

A dashboard was designed using Power BI aiming to visualize the behavior of sales in a dataset with
information from different retail stores. The results reflected that there is a similar trend in sales by type of store and a decrease in sales at the
beginning of the year. The dashboard included graphs like pie graphs, bar graphs and line graphs. 
Used Technologies: Power BI.
